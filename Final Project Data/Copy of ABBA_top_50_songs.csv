396324,The Name of the Game,https://genius.com/Abba-the-name-of-the-game-lyrics,"“The Name of the Game”, first called “A Bit of Myself”, was the first song to be recorded for ABBA’s fifth studio album, following the band’s European and Australian tour. It was their most complex composition yet – with Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad sharing the lead vocals but with solo passages from both women – and contained the influences of the laid-back California sound of the day.  The opening riff on bass and synthesizer is inspired by Stevie Wonder’s “I Wish” from the 1976 album Songs in the Key of Life, and both Andersson and Ulvaeus have acknowledged being inspired by Wonder’s music during this part of ABBA’s career.  A preliminary version of “The Name of the Game” was worked into the 1977 feature film ABBA: The Movie, for which it was written. When it was eventually finished, it was released as the lead single from ABBA: The Album in October 1977. Originally, another track entitled “Hole in Your Soul” was intended for release, but those plans were soon shelved. “The Name of the Game” was released with a live version of “I Wonder (Departure)” as the B-side. This B-side was one of several songs written for the mini-musical The Girl with the Golden Hair, written by Ulvaeus and Andersson and originally performed by ABBA on their 1977 world tour. The recording used on “The Name of the Game” single was recorded at Sydney Showground, Sydney, Australia on 3 or 4 March 1977. A studio recorded version of the song was included on ABBA: The Album.  “The Name of The Game” also marks the last time Stig Anderson helped with the lyrics of a single.",No Wikipedia annotation found (artist name not mentioned),"I've seen you twice, in a short time

There's a lot you can teach me

So I wanna know..



What's the name of the game?

Does it mean anything to you?

What's the name of the game?

Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me please, 'cause I have to know

I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow



And you make me talk

And you make me feel

And you make me show

What I'm trying to conceal

If I trust in you, would you let me down?

Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?

Could you feel the same way too?

I wanna know..



The name of the game



I have no friends, no-one to see

And I am never invited

Now I am here, talking to you

No wonder I get excited



Your smile, and the sound of your voice

And the way you see through me

Got a feeling, you give me no choice

But it means a lot to me

So I wanna know..

4710141,Just Like That,https://genius.com/Abba-just-like-that-lyrics,"Perhaps one of the most famous songs that have never been officially released, “Just Like That” was recorded in 1982 for ABBA’s original ninth studio album which was cancelled. The song’s synthesiser line would later be used on “Under Attack”, the final single ABBA released in 1982 before going their separate ways for almost 40 years.  Three versions are known to exist and all of them have surfaced on various bootleg compilations throughout the years after  . All versions are sung solo by Agnetha Fältskog, making it only the second track by ABBA to feature one vocalist – the first being “Like An Angel Passing Through My Room” from  , sung solo by Anni-Frid Lyngstad.  The first version, sometimes called the “slow version”, features a simpler, more relaxed instrumental focusing on a simple guitar line and light synthesisers. The second version is nearly identical but with the addition of Fältskog vocalising in the background in the beginning of the song, thus it is sometimes known as the “na na na version”.  The third and most well-known version is the completed version of the song, featuring the distinct saxophone line played by Raphael Ravenscroft. It was brought out of the vaults and digitally remastered initially for inclusion on 1993’s   but was replaced with the only other completed, then-unreleased song from ABBA’s 1982 recording sessions, “I am the City”. It would then be discussed for inclusion on 1994’s   box set, but its full inclusion was turned down in favour of only a short snippet being included as part of the “ABBA Undeleted” medley.","Just Like That may refer to:

Marveled at his style



Just like that...

He walked into my house

As smug as a cat

He was handsome and smart

Walked away with my heart

Just like that...

He found a temporary home in my flat

Telling innocent lies

Throwing dust in my eyes

But I led him on,

As though he only stopped awhile for a chat;

But my secrets he learned

Leaving no stone unturned



And once again, the river's flowing slowly,

Following the same and uneventful course.

Now the tears have dried,

it's become a pleasant break,

I recall without remorse.

But now and then

I wonder where he is

And I will admit,

he had something that I miss.

I guess he was a rolling stone;

The only one I've known.

396305,Summer Night City [Single Version],https://genius.com/Abba-summer-night-city-single-version-lyrics,"The recording sessions for “Summer Night City” began in early 1978. It had the working titles of “Kalle Sändare” and “Dancing in the Moonlight”. ABBA’s new recording studio, Polar Music Studio, had opened in May 1978, but had not been ready to use initially, so the primary backing track had been recorded at Metronome Studio. A 43-second ballad-style introduction to the song had been edited out to improve the overall quality, but nothing seemed to work. Allegedly, mixing the single took at least a week, far more than it took to mix any other track in ABBA’s recording history. They felt something was wrong with the recording but couldn’t put their finger on it. In the end, the song had an enormous amount of compression applied to it to give it a more “driving” sound. Agnetha has been quoted as saying she didn’t like the song to start with, as she felt “it wasn’t ABBA” but later on grew to like it. A reluctant ABBA decided to release “Summer Night City” as a single in September despite their disappointment with the track in its current form. The group still performed the song live on their 1979 world tour, though with the original introduction that had been removed from the studio recording. The previously unreleased version with the extended introduction was finally released as part of the box set Thank You for the Music in 1994.  Their ambivalence about the record has surfaced occasionally in interviews where Benny has said “we shouldn’t have released that one”, and Bjorn called the recording “really lousy”",No Wikipedia annotation found (artist name not mentioned),"Summer night city

395852,Hasta Mañana,https://genius.com/Abba-hasta-manana-lyrics,"Initially fearing that “Waterloo” might be too risky to enter for the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest, the group considered performing the ballad “Hasta Mañana” instead, as they thought that it was more in style with previous Eurovision winners. Eventually, they decided on “Waterloo”, primarily because it featured Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad sharing lead vocals, whereas “Hasta Mañana” had Fältskog as the sole lead vocalist. ABBA believed that this would give the wrong impression of them to the world.  The song was still known under its original working title “Who’s Gonna Love You?” when the backing track was recorded. The lyrics were later written by Stig Anderson while on a Christmas holiday to the Canary Islands and dictated over the telephone.  While the song was being recorded, they decided to give up on it at one point because none of them could sing it properly. Agnetha alone was in the studio and decided to play around with it. She felt if she could sing it in a Connie Francis style it would work — and it did.  In Australia, “Hasta Mañana” was later used as a B-side on the “So Long” single (which never charted). After being featured in the immensely popular The Best of ABBA TV Special, broadcast in March 1976, the song became a Top 20 hit in Australia and Top 10 hit in New Zealand.

In his book Bright Lights, Dark Shadows, Carl Magnus Palm wrote the following:

""Bjorn's maturity as a lyricist was showcased in songs like 'The Winner Takes It All', and the hidden gem, 'Me and I', featuring an Eartha Kitt-inspired lead vocal by Frida, showed a hitherto secluded side of Björn's imagination. Its split personality theme - I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde - combined with Frida's forceful delivery put a welcome darker spin on ABBA's largely bright and wholesome universe. It was a more literal version of broodiness that coloured songs like 'SOS' and 'Knowing Me, Knowing You'.""

In the early 1980s, the instrumental section of the song was used as theme music to BBC television coverage of bowls.

The title itself was coined by Stig, though the lyrics he provided were re-written by Ulvaeus. “SOS” was among the first of three songs recorded for the group’s 1975 album, ABBA and the opening track of their classic Greatest Hits LP released at the end of the same year.  The song opens with a piano intro, followed by the first verse sung by Fältskog. Palm described it as ‘Agnetha’s first 'heartbreak classic, wherein the tear-filled vocal delivery, her trademark, would blend an Anglo-Saxon pop melody, with a dash of Swedish melancholy.  Lyricist Ulvaeus has said that, after three years of trying to figure out what style would define them, ABBA found its identity as a pop group with the release of “SOS”. While Palm described it as ‘pure ABBA’.  During the band’s first visit to the United States, ABBA performed “SOS” on the long-running television program American Bandstand on 15 November 1975.

It was not included on any of their original albums but was later included as a bonus track on the 2001 reissue of Super Trouper.  ABBA: Let the Music Speak describes “Elaine” as a “bold and brazen up-tempo number”, adding that it has a “wealth of treated synth effects”. The pace remains the same throughout the song, and the intro has a “melodic riff that is squeezed and contorted over a series of suspended chords”. This is followed by a “whistlable refrain”. At the end of the second verse, the synths mimic the girls' voices.  Lyrically, the song explores darker themes, diverging from ABBA’s typical upbeat pop sound to delve into the story of a woman named Elaine, who is depicted as trapped in an oppressive situation, metaphorically living in a “dead-end street” with her hands and feet tied. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of inevitability and despair, using the imagery of a “goldfish in a bowl” to symbolize a life under constant scrutiny and devoid of privacy. ","Elaine may refer to:

At first called “Blinka lilla stjärna” (Swedish version of popular nursery rhyme ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star’, this hit single was the title track from ABBA’s 1980 studio album  . The song was written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus with lead vocals from Anni-Frid Lyngstad.    “Super Trouper” is a part of the   compilation, as well as in the   musical.  Super Troupers are huge spotlights used in stadium concerts and events. As popular ABBA was, the foursome were not really fond of performing onstage and liked performing in studios rather than going on tour. The idea is reflected in this song, which has an upbeat tempo while the lyrics take a more lonely approach to stardom.  “Super Trouper” topped the charts in West Germany, Great Britain, Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands. It was among the top 5 in Austria, France, Norway, and Switzerland, while it remained in Top 10 in Finland and Spain. It remains one of the most played songs of ABBA on YouTube.","Super Trouper may refer to:

396349,Under Attack,https://genius.com/Abba-under-attack-lyrics," “Under Attack” was the final single released by ABBA in 1982 before the band went on a nearly 40-year hiatus. Originally recorded for what would have been their original ninth studio album, it was instead first included on the ironically named compilation  , and was also released as a single with “You Owe Me One” as its B-side. It has since appeared on all remastered version of “The Visitors” album and various compilations.  Although the single was largely ignored upon its release in 1982, it has later come to be recognised as something of an underrated gem, with particular retroactive attention directed to its   and lyrics, with Rob Sheffield calling the song a “chilly synth-pop hallucination about getting chased down the street by a phantom lover, with that evil vocoder hook” in his ranking of ABBA songs in the Rolling Stone.","""Under Attack"" is a song by Swedish pop group ABBA, released in December 1982 as the second and final single from the compilation The Singles: The First Ten Years.


== Background ==
ABBA recorded ""Under Attack"" between 2 and 4 August 1982 at Polar Studios, Stockholm. The group had originally intended to release a new studio album, but instead decided to release a double-album compilation of their past singles while adding two new songs from the session. The two new tracks that made it onto The Singles: The First Ten Years were ""The Day Before You Came"" and ""Under Attack"". The latter would eventually be added to the expanded editions of The Visitors album.
On 11 December 1982, ABBA performed ""Under Attack"" on the BBC's Late Late Breakfast Show, in what was their last collective performance.


== Reception ==
""Under Attack"" was not a commercial success upon its release. ABBA's popularity was in decline and the two preceding singles (""Head over Heels"" and ""The Day Before You Came"") had failed to reach No. 1 anywhere. Although a Top 5 hit in Belgium and the Netherlands, and a Top 20 single in a couple of other European charts, it did not become a major hit anywhere else. It peaked at No. 26 in the United Kingdom. In Australia, where the group's popularity only a few years earlier had rivaled that of The Beatles, ""Under Attack"" only reached No. 96 in the singles chart. ""Under Attack"" became ABBA's lowest charting single since ""So Long"". After the single's release, ABBA went on a temporary hiatus that effectively lasted for almost 40 years.
""Under Attack"" is featured in the musical theatre production Mamma Mia! but not in the film.


== Music video ==
ABBA filmed a music video for ""Under Attack"" on 16 November 1982. The video shows ABBA navigating their way through an empty warehouse filled with red beacon lights. The video ends with the four members walking through the open warehouse door and into the distance, their backs to the camera, reaching the end of ABBA.

It would instead end up being released as the B-side to “Under Attack” when it was released as a single in 1982.  Like much of ABBA’s later material, the song’s lyrics explores the theme of a strained relationship from the perspective of a scorned partner. The track’s sound is cold and electronic, featuring heavy use of vocoders much like its A-side, “Under Attack”.  “You Owe Me One” first appeared on CD in 1994 as part of the box set “Thank You For The Music”, and would later appear on all remastered editions of “The Visitors”, except the 2001 remaster where it was excluded because Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus thought of it as being “just a jingle”, according to biographer Carl Magnus Palm.","""You Owe Me One"" (working title: ""Kamelo"") is a song recorded by Swedish pop group ABBA in 1982 for their unfinished ninth album. It was released as a B-side for the group's last single — ""Under Attack"" and on the 1997 and 2012 remasters of ""The Visitors"". It was excluded from the 2001 remaster due to the group's songwriters critical attitude towards ""You Owe Me One"". The vocal is shared by Anni-Frid Lyngstad, and Agnetha Fältskog singing in unison. For nearly four decades, ""You Owe Me One"" had stood as the last new song to be released by ABBA as an active group, until the 2021 release of ""I Still Have Faith in You"" and ""Don't Shut Me Down"" as a dual single from the band's ninth studio album and first in 40 years, Voyage.


== History ==
The song's recording sessions started on 3 May 1982. This single was recorded along with two other ABBA songs — ""I Am the City"" and ""Just Like That"". These two songs were kept unreleased until the mid 1990s, when ""Just Like That"" was edited and released as a promo single for the ""Thank You For The Music"" box set and ""I Am The City"" was released as a part of the ""More Gold: More Hits"" album. It has been noted that Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus dislike the song due to it being ""just a jingle"".

Written by Benny Andersson and Ulvaeus, the demo for “Does Your Mother Know” featured Ulvaeus on guide vocal and it was decided to keep this during the recording process. In 2018 lyricist Ulvaeus indicated that he would hesitate to write songs like these in the “Me too” age. In 2019, the single was re-released on picture disc.","""Does Your Mother Know"" is a song by Swedish pop group ABBA. It was the second single taken from their sixth studio album, Voulez-Vous, as was the B-side, ""Kisses of Fire"". The track is notable for its emphasis on male vocals, performed by Björn Ulvaeus, with female backing vocals.


== Composition and recording ==
With lyrics described by ABBA biographer Carl Magnus Palm as ""a daring tribute to cross-generational flirting in big city night clubs"", the track was recorded in February–March 1979 (initially under the working title ""I Can Do It"") and released as a single in April of that year. The distinctive guitar riff was taken from the recording of an unfinished song in August 1975. The middle section (""Take it easy..."") was adapted from a track called ""Dream World"". This was recorded in September–October 1978, but not released until it was included on a 2010 deluxe edition of the Voulez-Vous album.
""Does Your Mother Know"" was composed by Benny Anderson and Ulvaeus at the beginning of 1979 on a songwriting trip to the Bahamas, rather than on the Swedish island of Viggsö in the Stockholm Archipelago, where much of their music had previously been written. The inspiration for the lyrics came from a newspaper article, whilst the title was a phrase Ulvaeus had seen in a book or magazine. The demo featured his guide vocal and it was decided to keep this during the recording process. An early, rockier version of song (with a longer introduction) was performed partially live for the BBC TV special, Abba in Switzerland, recorded in Leysin on 16 February and broadcast across Europe in April 1979. The instrumental introduction on the released version featured a sound Anderson had created on an expensive Yamaha GX-1 analogue synthesizer, somewhat similar in its operation to the Minimoog. The drumming style was influenced by Carmine Appice, whom Ola Brunkert had seen perform with Rod Stewart at a concert in Leicester, while ABBA were in the United Kingdom doing some TV promotional work.
The video for the song was shot by Lasse Hallström, and like that for ""Voulez-Vous"", featured ABBA performing to a dancing audience as if in a discotheque.
""Does Your Mother Know"" featured in the jukebox musical Mamma Mia! and its 2008 film adaptation. In this version the gender roles were reversed, so that the lead vocal involved an older woman singing about a younger male's attempt to seduce her. American rock group R.E.M. covered the original song live, whilst British band Oasis used a variant of the opening guitar riff on their 2002 track ""The Hindu Times"".
In 2019, the single was re-released as a vinyl picture disc.

""Does Your Mother Know"" was another sizeable ABBA hit, hitting No. 1 in Belgium and reaching the top 5 in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands and Finland. It was also a top 10 hit in Australia, Canada, West Germany, Rhodesia and Switzerland. As of September 2021, it is ABBA's 14th-biggest song in the UK, including both pure sales and digital streams. 
Billboard felt the song sounds like those from the musical Grease, saying that ""the sweet, airy vocals contrast effectively with the rocking instrumentation."" Cash Box said that it is a ""rocking departure for the group, although the overall sound is still Europop."" Record World said that ""this buoyant pop-rocker is destined to become a classic."" In Smash Hits, Cliff White wrote: ""When it comes to pure, no-nonsense pop music performed with flair and no hint of condescension, Abba generally pull it off better than most. This time [...] they've excelled themselves with a lively rocker that I'll be happy to hear on my tranny any time over the next couple of months."" The Los Angeles Times was less flattering, Robert Hilburn referring disparagingly to the song (and ABBA's output in general) as ""cream puff"" music. AllMusic reviewer Donald A. Guarisco said in a retrospective review of the song that ""ABBA's recording balances the song's rock elements with dance music touches to create an intriguing dance/rock hybrid"" and that its ""macho feel is enhanced by a rockabilly-styled melody that flowers into a swinging chorus"".
In 2018, Rob Sheffield ranked ""Does Your Mother Know"" 11th in a list of ABBA's top 25 songs published by Rolling Stone. In 2021, Total Guitar rated it the group's fourth best guitar song, after ""Waterloo"",
""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"" and ""SOS"". It was placed 18th in a 2024 BBC Radio 2 poll to find listeners' favourite ABBA song.
The song featured prominently in the 2003 film Johnny English, starring Rowan Atkinson.

""Does Your Mother Know"" on YouTube
""Dream World"" on YouTube (relevant section at 1:04 onwards)","You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl you're only a child



Well I can dance with you honey

If you think it's funny

Does your mother know that you're out?

And I can chat with you baby

Flirt a little maybe

Does your mother know that you're out?



Take it easy (take it easy)

Better slow down girl

That's no way to go

Does your mother know?

Take it easy (take it easy)

Try to cool it girl

Take it nice and slow

Does your mother know?



I can see what you want

But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun

So maybe I'm not the one

Now you're so cute, I like your style

And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)

But girl you're only a child



Well I can dance with you honey

If you think it's funny

Does your mother know that you're out?

And I can chat with you baby

Flirt a little maybe

Does your mother know that you're out?



Take it easy (take it easy)

Better slow down girl

That's no way to go

Does your mother know?

Take it easy (take it easy)

Try to cool it girl

Take it nice and slow

Does your mother know?



Well I can dance with you honey

If you think it's funny

Does your mother know that you're out?

And I can chat with you baby

Flirt a little maybe

Does your mother know that you're out?"
396295,Should I Laugh or Cry,https://genius.com/Abba-should-i-laugh-or-cry-lyrics,"“Should I Laugh Or Cry” is an outtake from the recording sessions of ABBA’s eighth and final studio album of their original existence,  . It would appear as a B-side to the “One Of Us” single and was later included on the   box set in 1994 and all remastered editions of   album.  A particularly bitter song, the lyrics flip the script onto the male side of the relationship. Rather than being the woman lamenting the loss of her love, instead, here the female figure is openly and visciously dissatisfied with the man. A key theme is apathy – the lyrics mock this male figure’s ego as little more than a “big balloon” that leaves the woman unsure if she should laugh at him, or cry because the relationship has failed.","""Should I Laugh or Cry"" is a song by Swedish pop group ABBA, released as the B-side to the 1981 singles ""One of Us"" and ""When All Is Said and Done"" for the album The Visitors. Lead vocals were handled by Anni-Frid Lyngstad. It first appeared on the 1983 compilation album Thank You for the Music.


== Synopsis ==
ABBA - Uncensored on the Record says: ""Should I Laugh or Cry"" is ""a rather bitter song"" about the end of a relationship. ABBA: Let the Music Speak explains it as ""reflect[ing] a failing relationship's pre-emptive strikes of anger and contemplation"". The narrator is the ""emotionally afflicted party"", both ""volatile and pitiless"" in the verses yet ""tender and forgiving"" in the choruses. There is a sense that this is the last time the narrator will put up with this situation.


== Composition ==

The chorus harmonies are ""intricate"" and ""close-knit"". Agnetha's ""dreamy echo vocal"" adds a sense of sadness to Frida's ""fiery sentiments"". The song has ""deep percusive strikes"" and also a ""defiant electric glissando"" in the verses, and a ""lilting acoustic"" in the chorus.


== Release ==
While originally recorded on 4 September 1981 during sessions for the album The Visitors, ""Should I Laugh or Cry"" was ultimately not included. However, the song is included on Thank You for the Music (1983) and as a bonus track on remastered reissues of The Visitors.

395791,Dancing Queen,https://genius.com/Abba-dancing-queen-lyrics,"When “Dancing Queen” was released,   essentially made the world’s first Europop disco hit. The song was inspired by  ’s 1974 disco hit   and  ’s 1972 album,     Originally titled   the song was brought by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to Glen Studios in Stockholm, along with   another famed ABBA song. In this studio was where the then-new composition eventually became what it is now.  It was reported that when Andersson first played for bandmate Frida Lyngstad the backing track for this song,  ,   Lead vocalist Agnetha Faltskog  ,   “Dancing Queen” became ABBA’s  . But it also ranked high up in the charts in many other countries, from   to   to  .   ranked “Dancing Queen” at #174 on their list of  .","""Dancing Queen"" is a song by the Swedish group ABBA, released as the lead single from their fourth studio album, Arrival (1976). It was written by Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson. Andersson and Ulvaeus also produced the song. ""Dancing Queen"" was released as a single in Sweden in August 1976, followed by a UK release and the rest of Europe. It was a worldwide hit. It became ABBA's only number one hit in the United States, and topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, West Germany and the Soviet Union. ""Dancing Queen"" also reached the top five in many other countries.
Musically, ""Dancing Queen"" is a Europop version of American disco music. As disco music dominated the US charts, the group decided to follow the trend, replicating Phil Spector's Wall of Sound arrangements. Andersson and Ulvaeus have cited George McCrae's ""Rock Your Baby"" as a source of inspiration for the style of the song. The song alternates between ""languid yet seductive verses"" and a ""dramatic chorus that ascends to heart-tugging high notes"". It features keyboard lines by Andersson, which accentuate the melody's sophistication and classical complexity, while Ulvaeus and Andersson interlace many instrumental hooks in and out of the mix. Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad’s layered vocals have been noted for their dynamism, ""[negotiating] the melody's many turns flawlessly."" Lyrically, the song concerns a visit to the discothèque, but approaches the subject from the joy of dancing itself.
In 2015, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.


== Background and release ==
The recording sessions for ""Dancing Queen"" began on 4 August 1975. The demo was called ""Boogaloo"" and as the sessions progressed, Andersson and Ulvaeus found inspiration in the dance rhythm of George McCrae's ""Rock Your Baby"", as well as the drumming on Dr. John's 1972 album, Dr. John's Gumbo. The opening melody echoes ""Sing My Way Home"" by Delaney & Bonnie (from Motel Shot, 1971). Fältskog and Lyngstad recorded the vocals during sessions in September 1975, and the track was completed three months later.
During the sessions, Benny Andersson brought a tape home with the backing track on it and played it to Anni-Frid Lyngstad, who apparently started crying when listening.  Lyngstad said, ""I found the song so beautiful. It's one of those songs that goes straight to your heart"". Agnetha Fältskog later said: ""It's often difficult to know what will be a hit. The exception was 'Dancing Queen.' We all knew it was going to be massive.""
While working on the lyrics, the first half of the second verse was scrapped: ""Baby, baby, you're out of sight/hey, you're looking all right tonight/when you come to the party/listen to the guys/they've got the look in their eyes..."" It survives in footage from a recording session.
The band (especially Andersson) wanted to release ""Dancing Queen"" as the follow-up single to ""Mamma Mia"" but their manager, Stig Anderson, insisted that the more sedate and folksy ""Fernando"" should be first, as he felt it would appeal to a broader audience and so was more likely to be a hit. Therefore, whilst ""Dancing Queen"" premiered on both German and Japanese television during the spring of 1976, the song did not appear on vinyl until later that summer, having had its first live and domestic performance on 18 June 1976 during an all-star gala staged by Kjerstin Dellert at the Royal Swedish Opera (and shown on Swedish TV) in honour of King Carl XVI Gustaf and his bride-to-be, Silvia Sommerlath, who were married the next day. For their 1980 Spanish-language compilation-album Gracias Por La Música, ABBA recorded a Spanish version of ""Dancing Queen"", renamed ""Reina Danzante"", with Spanish lyrics provided by Buddy and Mary McCluskey. The track was retitled ""La Reina Del Baile"" when included on the compilation album ABBA Oro: Grandes Éxitos in the 1990s.
In 1993, in honour of Swedish Queen Silvia's 50th birthday, Anni-Frid Lyngstad was asked to perform ""Dancing Queen"" on stage, repeating ABBA's 1976 performance of the song at the pre-wedding gala for King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia. Frida contacted The Real Group and together they did an a cappella version of the song on stage at the Royal Opera House in Stockholm, in front of the king and queen. The Swedish prime minister at the time, Ingvar Carlsson, was also in the audience that night and said it was an ingenious idea to perform ""Dancing Queen"" a cappella. The performance was recorded by Sveriges Television (SVT) and is included in the biographical documentary Frida – The DVD and The Real Group's 1994 compilation album Varför får man inte bara vara som man är. When King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia attended the Tramp nightclub in London, the King requested that the DJ would play ""Dancing Queen"" owing to its use shortly before their wedding as previously mentioned.
For the soundtrack of the 1994 Australian film Muriel's Wedding, songwriters Ulvaeus and Andersson allowed the use of ""Dancing Queen"" and other ABBA hits. ""Dancing Queen"" was among the ABBA songs included in Mamma Mia!, the jukebox musical first produced in 1999 and adapted into film in 2008, as well as the sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018).
The first International Standard Musical Work Code was assigned in 1995 to ""Dancing Queen""; the code is T-000.000.001-0.


== Critical reception ==
""Dancing Queen"" received widespread critical acclaim upon release. According to Donald A. Guarisco of AllMusic, the track's ""sincerity and sheer musicality have allowed it to outlast the disco boom and become a standard of dance-pop."" The song's release also cemented ABBA as an international act and signified the beginning of the group's 'classic period', which would span the following four years. It has become a standard for dance divas like Carol Douglas and Kylie Minogue, and it has been covered numerous times by acts including Ireland's U2. The song has been adopted by the LGBT community and, according to Mojo magazine, remains one of the most ubiquitous ""gay anthems"".  Billboard found the theme of a person's greatest experience coming at a disco age 17 to be more substantive than most ABBA songs, and compared the vocal harmonies to the Mamas and the Papas.  Cash Box said that the song is ""backed by a strong upbeat, in keeping with the title"" and ""the hooks brought by lush vocal harmonies, as well as the reverb-soaked wall of sound that distinguishes this group, are present."" Record World said that ""the disco-styled treatment should make it a favorite [in the United States].""


== Chart performance ==
""Dancing Queen"" was a worldwide No. 1 hit, topping the charts in more than a dozen countries including ABBA's native Sweden (where it spent 14 weeks at the top), Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway (where it charted for 32 weeks (VG-lista Top 10), making it the 11th best-performing single in that country), South Africa and Rhodesia. ""Dancing Queen"" also topped the charts in the United States, ABBA's only No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was a Top 5 hit in Austria, Finland, France and Switzerland. The song sold over three million copies. The track was the fourth biggest single of 1976 in the UK.
In the UK Singles Chart, ""Dancing Queen"" was the last of three consecutive chart-toppers for ABBA in 1976, following ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Fernando"" earlier in the year. The song was re-released in the UK in 1992, taking advantage of an ABBA revival sparked by the success of Erasure's Abba-esque EP. The re-issued ""Dancing Queen"" reached No. 16 in the UK in September 1992.
As of September 2021, it is ABBA's biggest song in the UK, being their only million-seller with 1.65 million chart sales, including 93 million streams since 2014. In 2023, it was listed as the 102nd best-selling single of all time in the UK.
The song re-entered the Swedish Sverigetopplistan in 2021 and 2024. In 2022 it was reported to be the fifth most profitable song in Sweden in 2021, and to have more than 19 million weekly streams on Spotify.


== Legacy ==

Online music magazine Pitchfork positioned Dancing Queen at number 80 in its 2016 ranking of the 200 best songs of the 1970s. Reviewer Cameron Cook wrote it is ""a song so confident in its structure that its starts from the middle of its chorus"", adding that it ""bottles the out-of-body euphoria that accompanies dancing for dancing's sake, with no agenda or motive other than pure joy."" Eschewing the ""disco"" label sometimes attached to the track by latter-day critics, Cook called it ""a pitch-perfect portrait of the hedonistic disco scene they were mimicking via their own, more down-to-Earth Europop"".
In September 2016, The Guardian ran an article by Tim Jonze entitled ""Why Abba's Dancing Queen is the best pop song ever"". Jonze writes: ""Dancing Queen is beautifully produced: catchy and euphoric, the perfect backdrop for a song that encapsulates the carefree bliss of youth"". Several artists are cited as being influenced by the song, including Elvis Costello (""Oliver's Army""), MGMT (""Time to Pretend"") and Chris Stein of Blondie (""Dreaming"").
In 1993, Hong Kong singer Angela Pang covered this song in the Cantonese language.
The British online music industry magazine NME placed ""Dancing Queen"" at number 27 in its 2018 listing of the top 100 songs of the 70s, reviewer Rebecca Schiller calling it ""one of the greatest pop songs ever.""

In October 2024, during the ""Heavenly Harmony in Concert"", singer Julie Anne San Jose held a concert featuring this song and other secular songs at the altar of the Nuestra Señora del Pilar Shrine and Parish in Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro. She, Parish Priest Fr. Carlito Meim Dimaano, and Sparkle GMA Artist Center then issued an apology.

396188,Like an Angel Passing Through My Room,https://genius.com/Abba-like-an-angel-passing-through-my-room-lyrics,"“Like An Angel Passing Through My Room” is the closing track of ABBA’s eigth studio album,  , released in 1981. The song is a reminiscance on a lost love – a theme shared by much of   album.  The vocals are sung solo by Anni-Frid Lyngstad, being the first of only two tracks ABBA ever made featuring just one vocalist; the second being “Just Like That”.  “Like An Angel Passing Through My Room” is notable for being very minimally produced, having only a small amount of instrumentation: a clock tick, bells and strings, all from a MiniMoog. The stripped back instrumentation allows Lyngstad’s slightly effected vocals to be the main feature, noted for its ethereal, haunted quality.","""Like an Angel Passing Through My Room"" is the closing track on ABBA's 1981 album The Visitors. It was written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.


== History ==
Work began on this track on 26 May 1981 in Polar Music Studios. The first demo recording of the melody was made with Björn Ulvaeus singing a lyric with the title ""Twinkle, Twinkle"". Then the track was given the title ""Another Morning Without You"". In later recording sessions it was re-titled ""An Angel Walked Through My Room"", ""An Angel's Passing Through My Room"". At one point the song was turned into a disco track but this idea was eventually abandoned as the group felt it sounded too similar to ""Lay All Your Love on Me"". Initially the track featured vocal parts from both Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad but the final version of the song featured Anni-Frid as soloist. It is notable as being the only ABBA song to feature just one vocalist.
Unlike many other ABBA songs, the final mix of the track was sparsely produced – the entire track consisting of the soloist's treated vocals, synthesized strings, and a music box melody (also synthesized).  The sound of a ticking clock, also heard throughout the track, was produced by Andersson's MiniMoog.
The designer of the album sleeve for The Visitors, Rune Söderqvist, was partly inspired by this song's theme when he conceived the idea of photographing the group standing before Julius Kronberg's painting of an angelic-looking Eros.
In 2011, BBC Radio 4 in the UK broadcast a drama documentary, Like An Angel Passing Through My Room.  It featured a rare interview with Frida talking about her life and the song.  The piece was a meditation on being a fan, love and loss through the prism of pop music.


=== From a Twinkling Star to a Passing Angel ===
On 23 April 2012 a Deluxe version of The Visitors was released. One of its bonus tracks was a demo medley of ""Like an Angel Passing Through My Room"" called ""From a Twinkling Star to a Passing Angel"" put together by Benny Andersson, who feels that the song is one of the best that he and Björn wrote during the ABBA years, but is uncertain whether the final version is the ultimate one.  His view is shared by Agnetha Fältskog who described listening to the song as waiting for something that never comes. The compilation showed the experimentation of ABBA with the track, ranging from a full-tempo version (featuring the famous ABBA harmonies) that was later abandoned because of the similarity mentioned above, to a rather sober synthesized version close to the version that was eventually released. Early lyrics resembled the traditional ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", although these lyrics were meant as temporary to accompany the melody.  Benny was also involved in Anne Sofie von Otter's version of this song which was released on her album with Elvis Costello, For the Stars in 2000.


== Cover versions ==
The melody featured in the 1983 London version of the musical Abbacadabra and was re-titled ""When Dreamers Close Their Eyes"" with new lyrics by David Wood and Don Black.
German singer Nina Hagen performed the song live on a TV special.
In 1996, British singer Hazell Dean recorded a version for her album The Winner Takes It All: Hazell Dean Sings Abba.
In 1999, William Orbit recorded a version of the song with Madonna for her album Music but it was never released.  It was leaked onto the Internet in August 2008.
In 2000, Benny Andersson returned to this track when he was invited to play piano on Anne Sofie von Otter's cover version, which appears on the album For the Stars.
In 2006, Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø included a version on her album Into Paradise.
In 2011, Swedish soprano Myrra Malmberg included a version on her album Another World.
In 2015, Irish group Celtic Woman included a version on its album Destiny, performed by Mairéad Carlin.
In 2017, Dutch singer Roon Staal included a version on his albums Promise and The Christmas Album.

Like An Angel Passing Through My Room on YouTube","Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued

Everything comes back to me again

In the gloom

Like an angel passing through my room



Half awake and half in dreams

Seeing long forgotten scenes

So the present runs into the past

Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind

Like the embers as they die

Love was one prolonged good-bye

And it all comes back to me tonight

In the gloom

Like an angel passing through my room



I close my eyes

And my twilight images go by

All too soon

Like an angel passing through my room"

How I love you, girl 

When I hold you, baby, can't you see 

That's the way we whirl 



Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld 

Trust me, you just can't escape from reality 

Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld

Bright Lights Dark Shadows: The Real Story of Abba says the song has a ""jazzy, almost funky feel, lending it an aura of coolness"". Said there is a ""nice little intro to this one and a clever little bit of jazz playing from Janne Schaffer"". Don't Play with My Balls! says ""My Mama Said has everything you could want in a tune"" including ""big fat bass"" and ""passive aggressive parenting"". The sound of the suburbs described the song as ""oddly neglected"", and added that one can almost hear the early signs of famous ABBA sound fall into place. ABBA: let the music speak said the song is ""unfortunately one of those ABBA songs that earned a reputation more for its lyrical triteness than its musical substance"", arguing that the need to continue the rhyming structure ended up ""belittling a track that succeeds on all other levels"".

Lyrically, this classic tune finds a girl telling her boyfriend to take it easy and gently with her. She tells him, among other things, to tread lightly on her ground and touch her “gently like a summer evening breeze”. She wants him to take his time and do whatever it is he is doing to her in a gentle and soft manner. In the lyrics, it really isn’t made abundantly clear what she means by this. Is she using these words in their literal sense? Or is she using the words as a metaphor for something else?","""Andante, Andante"" (Spanish for Walker, Walker) is a song recorded by Swedish pop group ABBA for the album Super Trouper. It was released as a single in only two countries, El Salvador and Argentina. It was written by members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus on 9 April 1980 at Polar Music studios.

Buffalo News describes it as ""bouncy"". The Daily Telegraph lists the song as one of ABBA's hidden gems, offering it as an alternative to ""Waterloo"". It says the song ""Starts off slow, but quickly turns into a surreal, pop homage to low level sexual harassment"". Robert Hilburn of the Malaysian Star said ""My nomination for the best ABBA track that wasn't a hit in the U.S.: ""When I Kissed the Teacher"", a zestful number that recalls the teen passion of such Phil Spector productions as the Ronettes' 'Be My Baby'"". In a Voulez-Vous review, ""When I Kissed the Teacher"" is listed alongside ""Dancing Queen"" as an example of the group's ""soaring female harmonies, uplifting melodies, and festive instrumental touches"" in their earlier hits. Chris Joens of the Chicago Tribune, in a review of the Mamma Mia musical, noted ""A soundtrack has become a discography. I've even almost forgotten my favorite ABBA ditty, 'When I Kissed the Teacher', just because it's not in the show."" The Los Angeles Times said ""'When I Kissed the Teacher' is the most convincing thing Abba has done because it injects some sly, mocking humor and passion that offsets the group seriousness"". Abba – Uncensored on the Record said When I Kissed The Teacher is an example of what was ""expected of ABBA"". The Teacher in American Society: A Critical Anthology lists ""When I Kissed the Teacher"" with the Van Halen song ""Hot for Teacher"" and the Jethro Tull song ""Teacher"" as examples of ""how teachers are viewed by [students] as sexual objects.

Although their debut album did not bring them to global attention, it follows some standards of ABBA's style. The ballad is about what people can give each other to make their lives easier and create a better world.


== Reception ==
The basic aim of the ""People Need Love"" single was not to promote the quartet, since all four individuals had other commitments and did not have the time to form a permanent group (an example of this is the crediting; the single in most of the territories is credited to ""Björn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid""), but to promote the ""Björn & Benny"" duo, which was the singing and songwriting partnership of the two men. The women were simply guesting on the new ""Björn & Benny"" single. However, the very positive audience reaction was unexpected.
""People Need Love"" made the top 20 of the combined Swedish singles and albums chart, and reached No. 3 on the popular Swedish radio chart show, Tio i topp (The Top Ten). It was the foursome's first charting record in the United States, where it peaked at No. 114 on the Cashbox singles chart and No. 117 on the Record World singles chart. The Playboy Records U.S. release was credited to ""Bjorn & Benny (with Svenska Flicka)"", and according to ABBA's manager Stig Anderson, could have been a much bigger American hit, if not for the limited distribution resources of the label that was unable to meet the demand from retailers and radio programmers.
At the time of the single's release, the Ring Ring album had not been planned, since there was no intention to form a permanent group. However, the song was included on the album the following year. Although recorded earlier than most of the album, it can retroactively be considered the lead single from Ring Ring.
In the Netherlands and Belgium, the single had its release in August 1973 as the follow-up to the highly successful single ""Ring Ring"". However, it performed rather badly, reaching only No. 47 on the Radio Noordzee Top 50 from the Dutch service of Radio North Sea International.
Record World magazine noted the ""pleasant sound"" and suggested that this could be the ""label's first major hit"".

Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

Now that your father and sister are gone

You know the future is casting a shadow

No one else sees it but you know you're fate

Packing your bags, being slow and thorough

Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain

She stood on deck, just a tiny figure

Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain

I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still, strange as it seems to me
You brought it back to me
That old feeling



I, I don't know what you do

You make me think that you

Possibly could release me

I think you'll be able to

Make all my dreams come true

And you ease me



You thrill me, you delight me

You please me, you excite me

You're something I'd been pleading for

I love you, I adore you

I lay my life before you

I'll have you want me more and more

And finally it seems my lonely days are through

I've been waiting for you



I, I'm gonna make you mine

You're gonna feel so fine

You'll never want to leave me

I feel you belong to me

Someday you will agree

Please, believe me

Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally

I was so afraid Fernando

We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die

And I'm not ashamed to say

The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry



There was something in the air that night

The stars were bright, Fernando

They were shining there for you and me

For liberty, Fernando

There's no regret

If I had to do the same again

I would, my friend, Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando



Now we're old and grey Fernando

And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand

Can you hear the drums Fernando?

Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?

I can see it in your eyes

How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land



There was something in the air that night

The song   in the US dance charts in 1981, but has lasted in popularity over the years, becoming an ABBA staple. It was featured in the band’s jukebox musical (and its movie adaption),   and in 2006 was named the 66th greatest dance song of all time ","""Lay All Your Love on Me"" is a song recorded by Swedish pop group ABBA in 1980 for their seventh studio album, Super Trouper. The song was not intended to be a single but after a remixed version gained popularity in nightclubs, the song was released as the album's sixth and final single  in the summer of 1981, eight months after the album's release. At the time, it was the highest selling 12-inch record in UK chart history, where it peaked at No. 7. 
In 2006, Slant Magazine placed it at No. 60 on their list of the greatest dance songs of all time, and at 66 on the updated 2020 list.


== History ==
""Lay All Your Love on Me"" is an electro-disco song penned by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, with Agnetha Fältskog singing lead. Recording began at Polar Music Studios in Stockholm on 9 September 1980, with the final mix of the song being completed on 10 October 1980.
""Lay All Your Love on Me"" is known for a descending vocal sound at the end of the verse immediately preceding the refrain. This was achieved by sending the vocal into a harmoniser device, which was set up to produce a slightly lower-pitched version of the vocal. In turn its output was fed back to its input, thereby continually lowering the pitch of the vocal. Andersson and Ulvaeus felt that the chorus of the song sounded like a hymn, so parts of the vocals in the choruses were run through a vocoder, to recreate the sound of a church congregation singing, slightly out of tune. The song was not originally intended to be released as a single, but was issued in 12-inch form in the UK and a few other countries in 1981. ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" has since been much covered and is also featured in the Mamma Mia! musical (and its film adaptation), that showcases many of ABBA's hits.


== Music video ==
ABBA did not film a promotional video for ""Lay All Your Love on Me"", and so Epic hastily assembled a video (at a cost of £3,500) by using excerpts from the existing ABBA videos for ""Take a Chance on Me"", ""Summer Night City"", ""The Name of the Game"", ""I Have a Dream"", ""Voulez-Vous"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"". It was never shown on TV because Epic managers thought it ""wasn't needed"", but was included on the ABBA Gold VHS.


== Reception ==
As ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" was not intended to be a single, it was not released until 1981, the year after it had been recorded. It was only after a remixed version by Raul A. Rodriguez - (aka C.O.D) of Disconet - had soared in popularity in nightclubs, that it topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart (along with ""Super Trouper"" and ""On and on and On""). Therefore, the decision was made to release ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" in limited territories in 12-inch form, as opposed to the standard 7-inch record. It peaked at No. 7 in the UK, becoming ABBA's lowest charting single since ""I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do"" in 1975. However, reaching No. 7 in the charts was, at the time, the highest charting position achieved for a 12-inch only release in the UK. ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" also charted in Ireland (No. 8), Belgium (No. 13) and West Germany (No. 26).
As of September 2021, it is ABBA's 17th-biggest song in the UK, including both pure sales and digital streams.

== Synopsis ==
The song is about a couple (made up of the titular ""man"" and ""woman"") trying to save their marriage.


== Composition ==
Anni-Frid Lyngstad sang the lead vocals. The instruments used in the song are piano, synths, guitar and strings. The piano is used to add a colourful countermelody to the vocal pauses in the chorus, a similar technique to the ""descending double-octave riff"" used in ""Dancing Queen."" The synth is used in a ""chord-per-bar"" fashion throughout the verses, and strings take over in the chorus.


== Analysis ==
Abba: Let the Music Speak describes the song as ""one of ABBA's most introspective portraits of the fragility of human relationships"", adding that it is engulfed by a ""genuinely fatalistic quality"". It says that Frida's lead vocal is filled with ""urgency and inner suffering...insecurity and self-doubt"", filling the song with ""unsettling realism"". Both her performance and the musical progressions of the song illustrate an unsureness and lack of faith.


== Critical reception ==
The Sydney Morning Herald described the song as a ""big-treatment ballad"". Soon after the album was released, The Boston Globe described it as ""the most striking of the new songs"".

== Production and release ==
On 22 January 1979, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson went abroad to the Bahamas on a working trip to write new songs. They came up with up to four songs on this trip, one of which was given the working title of ""Tidemas Blåsning"" and released as ""Kisses Of Fire"".
The track was recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, on 7 February 1979, and mixed on 1 March 1979.
""Kisses of Fire"" was released as the B-side to the single ""Does Your Mother Know"" in April 1979, shortly before the release of the Voulez-Vous album. The single peaked outside the UK top 3, possibly as a consequence of the lead vocals in ""Does Your Mother Know"" being sung by Björn rather than Agnetha or Frida. ""Kisses of Fire"" was considered to  be a much more typical ABBA track. In Venezuela, “Kisses Of Fire” was released as an A-Side, with “Does Your Mother Know” as the B-Side.
The song was featured in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, performed by Panos Mouzourakis.

Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you
Kisses of fire, burning, burning

I'm at the point of no returning

Kisses of fire, sweet devotions

Caught in a land-slide of emotions

I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this

Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss

Kisses of fire

Kisses of fire



When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong

Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong

Losing you is a nightmare fate and to me it's new

Never before did you see me begging for more



Kisses of fire, burning, burning

I'm at the point of no returning

Kisses of fire, sweet devotions

Caught in a land-slide of emotions

I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this

Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss

Kisses of fire

Kisses of fire



Kisses of fire, burning, burning

I'm at the point of no returning

Kisses of fire, sweet devotions

Caught in a land-slide of emotions

Kisses of fire, burning, burning

(I'm at the point of no returning)

Kisses of fire, sweet devotions

I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss

(Caught in a land-slide of emotions)

Kisses of fire, burning, burning

I'm at the point of no returning

Kisses of fire, sweet devotions

Caught in a land-slide of emotions

7163786,Just a Notion,https://genius.com/Abba-just-a-notion-lyrics,"‘Just A Notion’ was originally written and recorded in the summer of 1978 during the early sessions for ABBA’s sixth studio album ‘Voulez-Vous’. However, the song was not included on the album. A 90-second snippet of a demo version of the song was released on the box set ‘Thank You for the Music’ in 1994. However, the complete song remained unreleased until 1999 when it appeared on the debut album of ABBA-tribute band Arrival.","""Just a Notion"" is a song by ABBA. It was released on 22 October 2021 as the second single from the quartet's 2021 album Voyage, following the dual lead single ""I Still Have Faith in You"" and ""Don't Shut Me Down"", released in September 2021. Originally written and produced for the group's 1979 album Voulez-Vous, the song was released over forty-three years later. The recording retains its vocals from 1978 but includes re-recorded instrumentation added much later, during the reunion.


== Background and recording ==
""Just a Notion"" was initially recorded in September 1978 during sessions for the album Voulez-Vous.  Although progressing beyond the demo stage, Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus became unsatisfied with it, deeming it ""unmixable"" and leaving it unreleased. However, a snippet of a rough mix by ABBA's engineer Michael B. Tretow was ultimately released on the box set Thank You for the Music in 1994.  Carl Magnus Palm has also confirmed that the verse included in the ""ABBA Undeleted"" medley is the second verse of the song. 
After ABBA reunited, and despite Andersson and Ulvaeus' prior criticism, ""Just a Notion"" was revisited for the reunion album Voyage. Benny Andersson recorded a new backing track with drums and guitars for the Voyage version, but it retains the vocals from the original 1978 version. ""Just a Notion"" was released as a single on 22 October 2021, before the November 5th release of Voyage. 
Prior to the full release of ABBA’s partial re-recording, a complete version was recorded by cover band Arrival, which occasionally featured original ABBA bass player Rutger Gunnarsson as a special guest, and was included on their 1999 album First Flight. While the full version of the song had not yet been released, it still featured the same lyrics as ABBA's original, even though much of the song remained unheard and unreleased at that point.


== Lyric video ==
ABBA released a lyric video on YouTube for ""Just a Notion"" to accompany its release. The video is directed by Mike Anderson and produced by Nick Barratt of the production company Able. The video received 583,000 views in its first 24 hours on YouTube. A brief teaser video on TikTok earned over a million views in its first few days.


== Critical reception ==
Emily Zemler of Rolling Stone calls ""Just a Notion"" ""buoyant"" and a ""hopeful, upbeat song."" Devon Ivie of Vulture writes that the song is ""a ridiculously happy romp that finds Agnetha, Björn, Benny, and Anni-Frid harmonizing about the joys of flirting while a power piano noodles in the background.""

Just a funny feeling, deep inside
A-ha-ha
That you're out there waiting
You're not sure I'm alone

And you wonder if I'm occupied

A-ha-ha

So you're hesitating



Just a notion

That you'll be walking up to me

In a while and you'll smile

And say hello and we'll be dancing through the night

Knowing everything from thereon must be right



Just a notion

But somehow I know I'm not wrong

There's something happening

That I just can't explain

If I try it's all in vain



Because it's just a notion, that's all

Just a feeling that you're watching me

A-ha-ha

Every move I'm making



Am I reading your mind

Cos it's almost like you're touching me

A-ha-ha

There is no mistaking



Just a notion

That you'll bе walking up to me

In a while and you'll smile

And say hеllo and we'll be dancing through the night

Knowing everything from thereon must be right



Just a notion

But somehow I know I'm not wrong

It is our destiny

There's nothing we can do

And tonight is very special

It's a night for me and you

A-ha-ha

A-ha-ha (In a moment a dream is about to come true)
